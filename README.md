We can try and extract the images for each listing so we can use for the website listings and host images on the map.

We need to fill in the gaps of the parsing status of the PDF, the PDF can potentially be parsed again. So far it does a 75% decent job of parsing but we have to create scripts to parse and clean further. Even then it does not complete the entire job.
