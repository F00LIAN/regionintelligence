      "Project Summary: The Ascon Landfill, located at the southwest corner of Magnolia and Hamilton, operated as a landfill from 1938 to 1984.  The landfill originally received drilling waste from oil production in the Huntington Beach area, during the city’s oil boom. Industrial and oil field wastes were disposed of at the landfill until 1971. From 1971 to 1984 construction debris was disposed of at the site.  Clean-up activity is privately funded by a group of companies.  A public scoping meeting was held in April  2013, commencing the environmental review process.  A Draft EIR and proposed final remedy document (Remedial Action Plan - RAP) were released in August 2013 for a 45-day review period.  In October 2014, a Recirculated Draft EIR was made available for a 45-day review period.  In June 2015, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) certified the Final EIR and approved the Final RAP.  Ascon submitted a Coastal Development Permit and Conditional Use Permit to the City for the final remedy.  More information can be found at http://www.asconhb.com/  \n",

      "Project Summary: To permit the expansion the existing Pierside Pavilion development. The project proposes to demolish approximately 400 sq. ft. of the existing structure including an elevator shaft and two stairwells - Phase 1; and construct a connecting four-story, 90 foot high, approximately 27,772 square foot mixed-use, visitor serving/office building - Phase 3 and 9,401 sq. ft. infill expansion by extending existing storefronts - Phase 2. The project proposes to expand the allowable uses within the Pierside Pavilion development from the previously approved limits established by Entitlement Plan Amendment No. 07-01 by adding 10,527 sq. ft. of retail, 5,705 sq. ft. of restaurant, and 21,441 sq. ft. of office. Retail area is proposed on the first level facing the perimeter of the building and office space is located behind or within the interior portions of the first level. Restaurant area is proposed on the second level and additional office areas are proposed on the third and forth levels. Approximately 3,069 sq. ft. of outdoor terraces are proposed on the second and third levels; and approximately 6,146 sq. ft. of outdoor dining is proposed on the second floor and rooftop deck. Parking will be provided within an existing two-level subterranean parking garage including 296 parking spaces on-site and share up to 234 parking spaces in the Municipal parking structure located at 200 Main Street. The project includes a variance request to allow a height of 68 feet (plus up to 90 feet for mechanical housing) for the new, expanded portion of the building in lieu of the maximum of 45 feet. Also, an entitlement plan amendment to amend Conditional Use Permit No. 10-017 is proposed to modify the location of the existing retail carts on public and private property.
